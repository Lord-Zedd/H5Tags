	<_field_explanation name="SIMULATION INTERPOLATION">This tag defines interpolation that will be used to smooth the motion of objects in distributed multiplayer games.  In bandwidth-constrained multiplayer games (i.e. most games), we will receive only one or two updates per second for faraway objects.  Even near objects may frequently be dropped to &lt;5 updates per second, especially crates, garbage bits, and similar less important elements of the simulation.  Between updates, each peer predicts the motion of each object.  These predictions are often wrong (by anything from an inch to dozens of feet).  The simulation interpolation system is responsible for correcting these mispredictions in as aesthetically pleasing a way as possible, without harming the integrity of the game.  The details of the technical implementation are beyond the scope of this explanation, but various configuration parameters are exposed here.  

The tooltips for each configuration parameter should be helpful.  Please see daldridge w/ questions or bugs.</_field_explanation>

Note that if a warp threshold is exceeded, rotation will be warped regardless of the value of this parameter." />
	<_field_custom name="Warp Thresholds" />
	<_field_explanation name="WARP THRESHOLDS">If any of the warp thresholds (position or rotation, global or xy) are exceeded, a warp in all domains (position and rotation) is executed.</_field_explanation>

	<_field_real name="rotation_warp_threshold:degrees#Threshold of rotation error beyond which we will warp instead of interpolating.  Set this to 180.0 if you don't want to warp based on rotational deviation (may be important for objects that often spin very fast, e.g. grenades or garbage bits)." />

		<_field_explanation name="SINGLE DOMAIN INTERPOLATION">Note that if either the position or rotation discrepancy thresholds above which we use blending are exceeded, we will blend in both domains (because blending is more accurate and once we blend in either domain, we are forced to warp the physics representation of the object, which is the main downside of blending.  Therefore, the second domain is essentially "free" after we pay for the first w/ a physics warp.

Note also that this discrepancy threshold is either WU or degrees, depending on context.  Check your context!</_field_explanation>
